# Hello, I'm John! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a Software Engineer Intern at SPS Commerce. I have a background in tech sales with 7 years of experience across retail and B2B. However, my fascination with technology and desire to do something I truly enjoy led me back to school. I recently earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and I am now writing software instead of selling it!

## My Journey  :compass:
My journey has taken some twists and turns, but I'm thankful for my unique experience and the opportunity to do something that I truly love, every day!

## What I'm Doing Now  :man_technologist:
I am working as an Associate Software Engineer II at SPS Commerce in Minneapolis, and loving every second of it! I'm learning new technologies, working on interesting projects, and collaborating with a team of incredibly talented and experienced individuals.
Additionally, I enjoy working on fun small personal projects. I'm currently developing a procedurally generated "who-done-it" game based on sentential/propositional logic.

## What I'm Looking For
I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges. If you have a project that you think I would find interesting, reach out!
