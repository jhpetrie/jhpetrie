# Hello, I'm John! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a Software Engineer Intern at SPS Commerce. I have a background in B2B tech sales with 7 years of experience. However, my fascination with technology and desire to do something I truly enjoy led me back to school. I recently completed a degree in Computer Science and I am now creating software instead of selling it!

## My Journey
My journey has taken some twists and turns, but I'm thankful for my unique experience and the opportunity to do something that I truly love every day!

## What I'm Doing Now
Currently, I'm honing my skills as a Software Engineer Intern at SPS Commerce. I'm learning new technologies, working on interesting projects, and collaborating with a team of incredibly talented and experienced individuals.

## What I'm Looking For
I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges. If you have a project that you think I would find interesting, reach out!
